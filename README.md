## What’s Cookin’
This application was created as a group project and it would be used for recipe tacking/ meal planning. 

## What does it do
When the page first loads the user take on the role of the random user whose name appears in the header along with their pantry on the right side of the page.  From the main page user scroll through a list of all of the recipes and save the ones that they like, which will then appear in their favorites tab. Users can also see the details of the recipes by clicking the “Click to see more button”. Inside of the pop-up you will find the instructions for the recipe, the ingredients, and the estimated cost in cents.  When a user clicks the “like” button the recipe will be saved to their favorite recipes tab. From the favorite recipes tab users have the option to remove recipes from their favorites or click the “Add to recipes to cook” button than that recipe will appear in the recipes to cook tab. 
	Inside of the Recipes to cook tab users can remove the recipe if they decide not to cook it the recipie.
